    <h4>Sunlight reflected off house windows into my eyes and</h4>
    <h4>sweat pooled on the top of my undie elastic. The grass</h4>
    <h4>on the nature strip drooped, as defeated as me. Ahead,</h4>
    <h4>half a block away, the sun-bleached awning over the</h4>
    <h4>milk bar door shimmered in the heat. It had to be cooler</h4>
    <h4>inside the shop than it was out here, didn't it?</h4>
    <h4>Stupid heat.</h4>
    <h4>Stupid Nan.</h4>
    <h4>It wasn't me who finished the milk. Dad had used</h4>
    <h4>the last of it and put the empty bottle back in the fridge.</h4>
    <h4>But did I tell Nan that when she thrust coins at me</h4>
    <h4>and snapped, "Rectify the situation, Robbie"?</h4>
    <h4>Nope.</h4>
    <h4>I just scuttled out the back door, right past my bike,</h4>
    <h4>towards Wobbly's milk bar.</h4>
    <h4>Beneath the milk bar awning, I wiped sweat from my</h4>
    <h4>face and pushed the door open.</h4>
    <h4>A bell tinkled and the smell of stale air and bread</h4>
    <h4>swamped me.</h4>
    <h4>Wobbly stood behind the counter watching Mrs</h4>
    <h4>Dixon, the town's biggest gossip, count coins from her</h4>
    <h4>purse.</h4>
    <h4>"How are you, Robbie?" asked Wobbly, looking up.</h4>
    <h4>"I'm well, thanks, Mr Cavendish." Everybody in</h4>
    <h4>Walgaree called Mr Cavendish Wobbly. Except me.</h4>
    <h4>Nan said calling him Wobbly was disrespectful.</h4>
    <h4>Mrs Dixon stopping counting coins and squinted at</h4>
    <h4>me. "How is Dawn, Robert?"</h4>
    <h4>"Well, thank you, Mrs Dixon."</h4>
    <h4>Ethel Dixon used to play cards with Nan on Mondays</h4>
    <h4>- until she brought packet biscuits for morning tea two</h4>
    <h4>weeks in a row. Nan and her "card girls" voted Mrs</h4>
    <h4>Dixon out and Thelma Fielding in.</h4>
    <h4>The last thing I wanted to do was talk to Mrs Dixon. I</h4>
    <h4>hurried to the milk refrigerator at the back of the store. In</h4>
    <h4>my rush to avoid the old crow, I just about cannoned into</h4>
    <h4>an Aborigine waiting by the newspaper rack. She stared at</h4>
    <h4>the foor, arms wrapped around her stomach. Her dress</h4>
    <h4>was faded and shoes worn. She was too clean to be from</h4>
    <h4>the Tip and the Station, the government mission, was the</h4>
    <h4>other side of town. She was from the Crossing for sure</h4>
    <h4>Mrs Dixon finished counting coins and glared at</h4>
    <h4>the newspapers. "May I also have The Sydney Morning</h4>
    <h4>Herald, Stan?"</h4>
    <h4>Wobbly sighed and limped out from behind the</h4>
    <h4>counter. As he took a newspaper from the rack,</h4>
    <h4>the Aborigine seemed to fold into herself.</h4>
    <h4>"Anything else?" asked Wobbly, when he returned to</h4>
    <h4>the counter.</h4>
    <h4>"That will be all, thank you, Stan." Mrs Dixon</h4>
    <h4>pressed another coin on the counter.</h4>
    <h4>I placed my palms against the glass of the refrigerator</h4>
    <h4>and, once the chill had seeped into my bloodstream,</h4>
    <h4>opened the door. As I grasped the milk bottle, the bell</h4>
    <h4>above the entrance tinkled.</h4>
    <h4>"Barry!" boomed Wobbly. "When did you get back?"</h4>
    <h4>"Hello, Wobbly. Morning, Mrs Dixon," said the</h4>
    <h4>man. "Arrived home last week." His voice had the usual</h4>
    <h4>Walgaree drawl, but something about it reminded me of</h4>
    <h4>an ABC newsreader.</h4>
    <h4>"Barry Gregory." Mrs Dixon clasped her gloved hands</h4>
    <h4>in front of her chest. "How is your dear mother coping.?"</h4>
    <h4>Anyone who didn't know better would think she actually</h4>
    <h4>cared about his mum. "I suppose she'll sell-"</h4>
    <h4>The man cut her off. "She's fine, thank you, Mrs</h4>
    <h4>Dixon.</h4>
    <h4>Mrs Dixon's eyebrows arched towards her silver</h4>
    <h4>hairline, Lips all right, she put the paper and bread ints</h4>
    <h4>her basket.</h4>
    <h4>What can I do for you, Barry?" asked Wobbly.</h4>
    <h4>"Our of ciggies. " He glanced around the store.</h4>
    <h4> "Sorry."</h4>
    <h4>Hesmiled at the Aboriginal woman. "You were here firs;</h4>
    <h4>He swept his hand from her to the counter. "After you"</h4>
    <h4>My mouth fell open.</h4>
    <h4>The woman peeked at him from under her eyelashes</h4>
    <h4>but didn't move.</h4>
    <h4>"I insist. Ladies first."</h4>
    <h4>Mrs Dixon clucked her tongue. "Now, Barry. She</h4>
    <h4>can't be served until you and Robbie have been, isn't</h4>
    <h4>that right, Mr Cavendish?" She didn't need to spell it</h4>
    <h4>out. White people were served before Aborigines in</h4>
    <h4>Walgaree, no matter what.</h4>
    <h4>Wobbly stood a little straighter. "That's right."</h4>
    <h4>Barry brushed his fringe back from his face. Unlike</h4>
    <h4>the rest of the male population of Walgaree, there</h4>
    <h4>wasn't a hint of Brylcreem in his hair and instead of a</h4>
    <h4>chequered shirt and trousers, he wore a T-shirt, shorts</h4>
    <h4>and sandals. On a weekday.</h4>
    <h4>"You don't mind waiting, do you, mate?"</h4>
    <h4>I jumped when I realised this Barry bloke was talking</h4>
    <h4>to me. Did I care if Wobbly served her first? I was</h4>
    <h4>supposed to, but ... my shrug was more a twitch than a</h4>
    <h4>real movement.</h4>
    <h4>"Good on you, mate," said Barry. "So, love, after you.</h4>
    <h4>The Aborigine, eyes fixed on the floor as though the</h4>
    <h4>mysteries of the universe were printed across it, didn't</h4>
    <h4>move.</h4>
    <h4>"Go on," said Barry. "It's okay."</h4>
    <h4>Mrs Dixon jerked her head at the woman. "Stan, if</h4>
    <h4>you serve her, I'll take my business elsewhere. And the</h4>
    <h4>Catholic Ladies' Guild will hear all about it.</h4>
    <h4>Beads of sweat formed on Wobbly's forehead. "Barry,</h4>
    <h4>you've made your point, mate."</h4>
    <h4>"Please." The Aborigine woman's voice was a whisper.</h4>
    <h4>"I'll wait."</h4>
    <h4>Barry sighed. "At least serve the kid before me."</h4>
    <h4>Wobbly's breath rushed from him. "Just the milk,</h4>
    <h4>Robbie?"</h4>
    <h4>"Yes, thanks." I stumbled past the black woman to</h4>
    <h4>the counter.</h4>
    <h4>Mrs Dixon huffed. As she left the milk bar, the bell</h4>
    <h4>above the door shuddered more than tinkled.</h4>
    <h4>Wobbly looked over my shoulder to Barry. "Now,</h4>
    <h4>Barry, you know how this town works. Don't go stirring</h4>
    <h4>up a hornet's nest."</h4>

    <h4>The screen door slammed behind me. I counted - one,</h4>
    <h4>two, three.</h4>
    <h4>"Don't slam the door," bellowed Nan, right on cue.</h4>
    <h4>"How many times do I have to tell you?"</h4>
    <h4>Bluey the budgie screeched in support.</h4>
    <h4>I trudged from the darkened porch to the gloomy</h4>
    <h4>kitchen. Anytime the weather forecast was for a day of</h4>
    <h4>eighty degrees Fahrenheit or more, which was pretty</h4>
    <h4>much every day from October to April in Walgaree,</h4>
    <h4>Nan closed the curtains, blinds and doors to "keep the</h4>
    <h4>place cool". It was as though she was a vampire, like</h4>
    <h4>Dracula, and scared of the light. All her closing up just</h4>
    <h4>made the house hotter and more depressing.</h4>
    <h4>Nan was still ranting about doorframes and springs</h4>
    <h4>and her poor nerves when I entered the kitchen.</h4>
    <h4>Honestly, young man, I'm at my wits' end, trying to</h4>
    <h4>civilise you." She stood by the kitchen bench where</h4>
    <h4>she'd lined up the best china teacups ready for the card</h4>
    <h4>girls.</h4>
    <h4>Bluey screeched and flapped. Nan bustled to the cage</h4>
    <h4>and kissed the air.</h4>
    <h4>"Sorry, Nan," I muttered, placing the bottle by the</h4>
    <h4>milk jug.</h4>
    <h4>"Next time we run out of milk, tell me." She didn't</h4>
    <h4>turn from Bluey.</h4>
    <h4>"'Yoo-hoo, Dawn." Thelma Fielding's voice made me</h4>
    <h4>think of the cockatoos in the gum trees by the river.</h4>
    <h4>"She's ten minutes early," hissed Nan, before calling,</h4>
    <h4>"Coming, Thelma." She turned back to me, voice</h4>
    <h4>flattening. "Fill the milk jug. And stay out of the sitting</h4>
    <h4>room.Â»</h4>
    <h4>"Yes, Nan." Why would I want to go anywhere near</h4>
    <h4>old crones drinking tea and gossiping?</h4>
    <h4>She took off her apron, blew the budgie another kiss</h4>
    <h4>and bustled to the front door.</h4>
    <h4>Bluey Auttered around the cage. A spray of seed</h4>
    <h4>husks scattered across the lino.</h4>
    <h4>"How are you, Dawn, dear? Stinker of a day, isn't</h4>
    <h4>it? Never mind ..." Mrs Fielding's endless stream of</h4>
    <h4>words swirled through the house like leaves caught in</h4>
    <h4>a northerly wind. The moment the kettle hinted at</h4>
    <h4>boling I filled the respor and escaped to my boding,</h4>
    <h4>'Is son as I opened the doos, I knew Man had leg</h4>
    <h4>in here. It wasn't the smoothed bedspread or the det</h4>
    <h4>curtains that gave it away. The air was somehow bruiser</h4>
    <h4>Why couldrit I have one place to escape from he</h4>
    <h4>and Dad?</h4>
    <h4>I stomped to the window and fung back the curains</h4>
    <h4>A blast of hear and light hit me. Once my eyes adjusted</h4>
    <h4>I stared outside, past the skeletal clothes line at the end</h4>
    <h4>of the cement path and the sagging wire of the chook</h4>
    <h4>house, to the giant gum tree looming over our backyard,</h4>
    <h4>Nan hated that tree because it dropped bark and leaves</h4>
    <h4>and twigs into our yard.</h4>
    <h4>At the top of the tree a magpie plunged its beak</h4>
    <h4>between its feathers. It shook itself, lifted its beak to</h4>
    <h4>the blue sky and warbled. A thought drifted into mind,</h4>
    <h4>riding on the back of the magpie's carolling.</h4>
    <h4>Was this it?</h4>
    <h4>No nooks or crannies to escape into?</h4>
    <h4>A town of trees bowed by heat, grass sucked dry and</h4>
    <h4>dusty footpaths?</h4>
    <h4>A neurotic budgie, a pain in the bum grandmother</h4>
    <h4>and a father who didn't care about anything except for</h4>
    <h4>the bank or the news?</h4>
    <h4>I pressed my forehead against the window. Not for</h4>
    <h4>the first time, I wondered how different my life would</h4>
    <h4>have been if Mum was alive, if we still lived in Inverell</h4>
    <h4>and if Dad wanted to be around me.</h4>
    <h4>With a huge effort, I pushed back from the window</h4>
    <h4>and crept to the kitchen to make a cordial.</h4>
    <h4>Voices, punctuated by Bluey's chirps, filled the stifling</h4>
    <h4>air. Between Bluey, Mrs Fielding's cockatoo squawk, Mrs</h4>
    <h4>Scott's canary trill, Miss Johnson's sparrow twitter and</h4>
    <h4>Nan's goose honk, it was more an aviary than a house</h4>
    <h4>"She'll have to sell the caravan park," trilled Mrs</h4>
    <h4>Scott.</h4>
    <h4>"Well, of course. It's hardly the place for a woman to</h4>
    <h4>live alone, is it?" declared Nan.</h4>
    <h4>"Perhaps her son will help," said Miss Johnson.</h4>
    <h4>"He's overseas," said Nan. "Has been for years. Didn't</h4>
    <h4>even come back for his own father's funeral."</h4>
    <h4>"Hmmm." I imagined Mrs Fielding's beady eyes.</h4>
    <h4>That woman was made of animal parts. She had a bat's</h4>
    <h4>face, a cockatoo's voice, a wombat's body and snake's</h4>
    <h4>venom dripped from most things she said. "If you ask</h4>
    <h4>me, Arthur spent too much time with those darkies.</h4>
    <h4>And his son-</h4>
    <h4>Nan took over with a scoff. "Always was too high and</h4>
    <h4>mighty. He won't return to Walgaree."</h4>
    <h4>"Didn't you hear, Dawn?" China chinked. I guessed</h4>
    <h4>Miss Johnson had set her cup on the saucer. "Bet saw</h4>
    <h4>him yesterday at the petrol station. Didn't you, Bet?"</h4>
    <h4>"Indeed, I did," said Mrs Scott.</h4>
    <h4>"Scruffy-looking</h4>
    <h4>fellow these days. Needs a haircut and a good wash"</h4>
    <h4>This time a chorus of squawks and tweets filled the</h4>
    <h4>soupy air.</h4>
    <h4>Gossipy old bags.</h4>
    <h4>I wrenched open the fridge as information shifted</h4>
    <h4>in my head, pieces slipping into place like tumblers in</h4>
    <h4>a lock.</h4>
    <h4>Dead husband.</h4>
    <h4>Son overseas.</h4>
    <h4>Scruffy, long hair.</h4>
    <h4>The Arthur they spoke about was Mr Gregory from</h4>
    <h4>Walgaree Caravan Park. His funeral was last week. I knew</h4>
    <h4>because Id heard Nan on the telephone, mobilising the</h4>
    <h4>CWA troops to make cakes, scones and sandwiches for</h4>
    <h4>the afternoon tea at the RSL.</h4>
    <h4>I never met Mr Gregory, but I'd seen him around. Over</h4>
    <h4>the winter he worked at school, pruning trees and shrubs,</h4>
    <h4>looking after the rugby pitch and fixing the flaking paint</h4>
    <h4>on the gutters. When I was stuck on algebra or sick of</h4>
    <h4>Dickens, Id watch him through the classroom window,</h4>
    <h4>his shirt buttoned to his throat and wrists, tucked into his</h4>
    <h4>belted trousers. His tools gleamed in the winter sunlight.</h4>
 <h4>One time, on my way home from school, Id seen Mr</h4>
Gregory behind the garden shed, hosing off his spade and</h4>
rubbing oil into the handle with rag.</h4>
The man at the milk bar with the long hair and</h4>
strange accent, the one who asked Wobbly to serve the</h4>
Aborigine first, had to be his son.</h4>
"Eavesdropping, are we?"</h4>
I hadn't heard Nan enter the kitchen.</h4>
"I was looking for lemon squash," I stammered.</h4>
She tsked, eyebrows pulled down. "Drink water. And</h4>
Robbie.</h4>
I looked into her eyes.</h4>
"Eavesdroppers never hear any good of themselves."</h4>
She turned and left the room before I could answer.</h4>
Bugger this. I stormed out the back door and grabbed</h4>
my bike.</h4>
